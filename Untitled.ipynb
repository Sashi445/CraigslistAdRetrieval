      "When Karnataka CM Shri Siddaramaiah issued a statement that Bruhut Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) was facing fund crunch and there is no money available for the BBMP to take up new projects, Rajeev wrote to the Chief Minister stating that Bangalore was not facing any shortfall in revenue but is actually suffering from corruption, wasteful Expenditure & vested Interests and this was the cause, in fact, the main cause for the city’s Municipal authority edging towards bankruptcy.  Rajeev highlighted the poor Governance and corruption over the last several years and suggested measures to stem the decline. Although initially few ministers from the Government denied the allegations of Bankruptcy, the Mayor himself wrote to Rajeev, seeking his suggestions and advice to improve the financial condition of the city administration. Many media reports revealed the massive corruption in the BBMP and how the intervention of vested interests had caused great damage to the city and its financial state, validating Rajeev’s argument.\n",

      "Rajeev Chandrasekhar was hand-picked by the BJP President Amit Shah to lead the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Kerala as its Vice Chairman on 26th September 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev believes that politics in Kerala needs a transformation that is capable of unleashing the state’s full potential. And that an alternative political front based on equitable development for all including the many lakhs of downtrodden as well as opportunities for the youth is the need of the hour. The NDA, with its rapidly growing vote share and popularity he feels, is that alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his ancestral roots in Kerala, he has in this short period, taken up many critical issues within the state and also helped to address grievances of many Keralites living outside the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has brought the National focus on one of the most burning issues in Kerala - the rise in political violence. He believes political violence is not just lives and disrupting families – it has a big impact on private and public investments into the state and highlighted that investors don’t want to invest and create jobs in a state that is being perceived as state sponsor of Political violence with no heed or respect for law or individual rights and liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has persistently demanded de-politicization of Police in the state and urged the State Government to take the initiative – and start getting the police to enforce the law instead of being complicit in law breaking or ignoring the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the more serious issues Rajeev has raised is the radicalization of youth and ISIS growth in Kerala stating that it is tragic for a state that has had a long record of Communal harmony and inter-faith relations to be rushing headlong into a sharp deterioration of the same due to the politics that is giving a go-by to law enforcement for the sake of communal politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area in focus of Rajeev’s work has been the protection of the eco-sensitive zone of Munnar. He raised the Munnar issue in the Parliament and highlighted the extensive encroachments of forest land and illegal constructions by the political-business-bureaucratic mafia going on for decades. He continues to pursue the issue and is determined to ensure all encroachments and illegal constructions in Munnar, Pallivasal and CHR are evicted in a time-bounded manner under FC Act and culprits including politicians involved are held to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has taken up other significant issues like education and pay structure of Nurses and sought the status of implementation of MCI recommendations to raise the salary of nurses working in private hospitals at par with those of nurses in government hospitals across the nation in Parliament. He also actively pursued the case of a Keralite missing in Kuwait and ensured his safe return home and brought attention to the rising cases in vector-borne diseases in Kerala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has voiced his concern over the state of economy and employment in Kerala – the political violence, radicalisation, and spread of ISIS and lack of reforms in education all have caused global investors to refuse to even consider Kerala as a destination and this driven away investors from the state and prevented job opportunities for the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev continues to raise these important issues that impact Kerala within and outside Parliament, in the media and with the public.\n",

      "Rajeev Chandrasekhar has focused on and taken up a wide array of macro-economic and micro-economic issues in his two terms in Parliament. These include the restructuring of Public Sector Banks, creating Transparency in the management of Public Assets and repairing key sectors in the economy to revive growth amongst others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev advocates for the creation of a new architecture, a coherent economic vision, prudent financial management and a team of credible leaders to ensure revival of the economy. He believes that there is a need to redefine the role of the Government and restore credibility of government institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Transform India, Rajeev has focused on multiple areas providing solutions and roadmaps to many critical issues pertaining to the Government of India’s economic and governance policy decisions. Rajeev’s insight made him one of the first individuals to raise concerns regarding the ad hoc allocation of 2G licenses in 2008 – which in the years to come became one of the main indictments against the UPA government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has asserted the need for reforms in the public sector banking (PSB) system and has urged the Government to consider stronger mechanisms for installing an internal culture of transparency and accountability in decisions taken by PSBs. He has highlighted the seriousness of the issue of Non-Performing Assets in PSB’s as it involves Tax payers’ money and advocated a joint effort by the Government, RBI and the Board of Management of the Banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has over the past ten years advocated for an integrated approach to Economic reforms in the country that address issues of banking, manufacturing & production and technology & governance. Rajeev has maintained that most important structural moves are the creation of a social security net via pension and insurance, and the MUDRA bank that will also bring the bottom of pyramid into the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong votary for Transparency in Governance, Rajeev feels the change in the government’s approach towards public assets is in itself a transformation. Rajeev has maintained that there is a need for a comprehensive public policy especially when it involves commercial terms of monetisation of public assets like spectrum, minerals, natural resources, etc. He firmly believes a public policy should be based on a simple objective and test of ensuring maximum benefits to the exchequer and public\n",
      "\n",
      "A proponent for Independence in monetary policymaking in India just as it is recognised the world over, Rajeev maintains that important and first steps towards reforming the economy must entail decisive governance and policy action that spurs foreign and domestic equity investor sentiment and restart equity investment cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highlighting that the issue of deciding on interest rates has resulted in much friction between the government and the RBI, Rajeev believes the RBI should be kept autonomous even if it does not pander to government’s expectations all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'change' to India’s economic architecture according to Rajeev could be deep and transformational. It involves funding the unfunded, and unlocking the potential of a new pool of entrepreneurs and future taxpayers in this country\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajeev has served on select committees that finalised legislations like GST, Insurance,  Mines & Mineral Regulation Bill, Auctions in Spectrum and the Real Estate Regulation Bill amongst others.\n",
